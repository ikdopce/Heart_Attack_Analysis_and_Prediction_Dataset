# Heart_Attack_Analysis_and_Prediction_Dataset
#### To execute the dataset, I used several training models to achieve maximum results. He did it best in the field of LogisticRegression, which I had no doubt about. He also did a good job CatBoost which I also had no doubt about.
###### Logistic Regression showed us the result 0.8552631578947368, which is a fairly good result
###### RandomForest showed us the error 0.2776315789473685, quite a small mistake
###### And RabdomForest showed us the maen squared error 0.14421052631578946, very small error
###### CatBoostClassifier didn't go far from LogisticRegression and showed us the result 0.7625088090204369, not bad
